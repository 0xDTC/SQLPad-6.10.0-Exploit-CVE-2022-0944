# SQLPad 6.10.0 Exploit (CVE-2022-0944)

This Bash script exploits an RCE vulnerability in SQLPad 6.10.0, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by abusing the `host` and `database` fields in SQLPadâ€™s MySQL database connection settings. The exploit leverages SQLPadâ€™s unsanitized handling of the `child_process` module in Node.js to execute arbitrary commands, ultimately opening a reverse shell on the attacker's machine.

## Prerequisites
1. **Netcat Listener**: Ensure you have a listener active on your machine with `nc -lvnp 9001`.
2. **Target Server Access**: This exploit assumes you can communicate with the vulnerable SQLPad instance.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository** (or copy the script locally).
2. **Run the Script**:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/HTB/machines/sightless]
â””â”€$ ./CVE-2022-0944
Please make sure to start a listener on your attacking machine using the command:
nc -lvnp 9001
Waiting for you to set up the listener...
Press [Enter] when you are ready...
Please provide the target host (e.g., x.x.com): 
x.example.com
Please provide your IP address (e.g., 10.10.16.3): 
0.0.0.0
Exploit sent. If everything went well, check your listener for a connection on port 9001.
```

3. Follow the script prompts to input the target host and your IP address, then wait for a reverse shell connection.

## Details
- **CVE**: CVE-2022-0944
- **Affected Version**: SQLPad 6.10.0
- **Vulnerability**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via template injection
- **Impact**: This exploit allows an attacker to execute commands on the target server with the privileges of the SQLPad process.
